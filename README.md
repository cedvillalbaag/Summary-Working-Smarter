# Summary-Working-Smarter
Summary of the book: “Working Smarter, Not Harder” by Timo Kiander.

### Introduction
This book is about productivity strategies. Keeping in mind that they can be applied to the work day, and take personal performance to another level.

### The basic blocks of productivity
Personal productivity is like construction, you must have a good foundation, otherwise the construction will collapse.

To have a good foundation for personal productivity, the following building blocks must be in place:
- Proper mindset.
- Physical activity.
- Optimal nutrition.
- Sufficient sleep.

### Strategies to make the days more effective and satisfying:
#### 1. Have a powerful start to your day
- Mornings give you the personal time you will need.
- Mornings give us flexibility and enjoy the day more.
- Start with the decision, set the target time and commitment for your plan.
- Adopted this new schedule, take full advantage by:
  - Meditating.
  - Reading a book.
  - Exercising.
  - Writing.
  - Building your business.
- You can take advantage of the early hours to get closer to your goals.

#### 2.	Understand your optimal work rhythm.
- To improve focus and effectiveness, try to find an optimal work style.
- We can mention the following:
  - Pomodoro Technique.
  - 90-minute intervals.
  - 52-17.
  - A personal rhythm.
- All these styles assume that you use a timer. This way you will know how to take a break from your computer.
- You should be sure to do something energizing each time you take a break.

#### 3. Keep distractions under control.
- You must protect your hours from distractions so that you can really work on what you plan to do.
- There are three types of distractions to which you are exposed:
  - Communication Tools (Internet, Messages, Email, Social Networks).
  - Other People
  - Internal Distractions (Thoughts and ideas that interrupt us while we are trying to do our work).
- Keep a piece of paper on your desk to write down internal distractions and review them later.


#### 4. Never start your day without planning it.
- Get into the habit of planning your day. This way you will know exactly what you should be focused on when the day begins.
- You don't have to operate from memory, but from a list in front of you.
- Select a piece of paper or a program to store your to-do list.
- Write down the tasks and then prioritize them. Select the 3 most important tasks.
- Do the preparatory work related to those three tasks.
- You must make your list closed. You should add a line at the end of your list.
- You can add other tasks after the line drawn, but you will not take them into account.

#### 5.	Drink water.
- Drinking water has many benefits.
- It improves brain performance.
- You should keep a glass of water at your desk.

#### 6.	Identify the most important tasks and do them first.
- To define the importance of tasks consider:
  - The long-term effect.
  - The short-term effect.

#### 7.	Ask the following questions about your next meeting
- Do I have to attend?
- Is it possible to conduct it virtually?
- Is the meeting necessary?
- Is there an agenda for the meeting?
- Is it possible to limit the duration of the meeting?
- Is it possible to test the meeting technology before the meeting starts?

#### 8.	Group similar tasks
- Process similar tasks during pre-determined time windows.
- Examples:
  - Process emails.
  - Make calls.
  - Process messages from social networks.
  - Have all quick meetings in one meeting.

#### 9.	Process your email effectively
- Define your review times.
- Open your email only when you check your inbox.
- Turn off automatic notifications.
- Let others know about your checking routine.
- Create a routine every time you check your email.

#### 10.	Delegate the right way
- Delegating is important because it not only helps with the workload, but it allows us to focus on the most important activities without making mistakes.
- Be sure to document all necessary work steps in sufficient detail so that someone else can complete the task.
- Be sure to define a deadline.
- Make sure you have constant follow-up on the delegated task.
- Keep improving the delegating process on an ongoing basis.
- Make sure you spend enough time on previous points to get the results you want.

#### 11.	Take breaks
- People's performance improves when they take breaks.
- When your focus improves, so does your productivity.
- The best ways to take breaks:
  - Make yourself a cup of coffee or tea.
  - Socialize with colleagues or family.
  - Meditate
  - Take a snap.
  - Exercise
  - Eat a healthy snack
  - Go outside and breathe fresh air.

#### 12.	Take care of your toads the right way.
- If there is one task that we tend to put off more than any other, it is a “Frog Task”.
- If you take care of the most challenging task first thing in the morning, the rest of the day will go much smoother.
- The longer you go without finishing that task, the more you keep thinking about it.

- So, how do I prepare to eat my Frog Task:
  - Mentally prepare myself for what we are supposed to do.
  - Try to do it first thing in the morning.
  - Imagine how I would feel after having dealt with this situation.

#### 13. Create a checklist
- A checklist is a list of items that help us remember how to execute a task consistently.
- Benefits of using checklists:
  - Get your work done quickly.
  - Create predictable outcomes for tasks.
  - Document your processes for when you delegate your work.
  - Create habits (making sure you do tasks the same way every time.)

#### 14.	Take a snapshot of your work before vacation.

#### 15. Focus on one thing at a time
- To maintain focus on one thing, do the following:
a. Break the task into smaller activities.
b. If necessary, create a plan for executing the task.
c. Control distractions around you as much as possible.
d. Take advantage of time blocking when performing a task.

#### 16.	Control busy work
- Consider the following suggestions:
  - Learn to say NO.
  - Review which tasks are most important, and proceed according to priorities.
  - If someone asks you to do a task, you can ask them to help you with your other tasks in return.
  - To improve your work performance create some checklists.

### Conclusion:
- The most important thing is that you put these tips into action and truly put them to the test. This is the only way to make your days more organized and productive.
